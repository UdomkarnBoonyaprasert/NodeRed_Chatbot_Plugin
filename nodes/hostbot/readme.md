# Hostbot
The purpose of this custom node is to generate a url link and open a new tab which navigates to a webpage that 'host' the created chatbot.

## Usage
It needs be connected to the metanode (with api key and url included), or create_watson so that it will automatically choose the created workspace.

To query/chat to the dicovery function, a Dialog node must connect to a Discovery environment node. The chatbot will give the user reply from discovery instead of the replay from that Dialog node. Please see example below.

</p>

The msg.payload of this node contains the snip of the chatbot widget which can be inserted into webpages. It can be viewd by connectting a node just as debug to output the code.
