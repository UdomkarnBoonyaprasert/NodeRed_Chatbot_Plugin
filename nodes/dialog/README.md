# Dialog node documentation
This node is the main components of the chatbot's dialog tree. Each node refers to one input and reply given by
the user and replied by the chatbot. This however, is customisable and thus can be changed as will be demonstrated

This is one of the core nodes of the system. It is what makes up the dialog tree, which is the
