# Dialog node documentation
This node is the main components of the chatbot's dialog tree. Each node refers to one input and reply given by
the user and replied by the chatbot. This however, is customisable and thus can be changed as will be demonstrated 
below. 
## Overview

## Components
# If assistant regognizes
In this component the user can choose, create or edit the intent/entity that the dialog node responds to.
# Response
In this component the user can create the response that the chatbot gives to the recognized intent/entity.
The response can be a text response, a selectable option, a selectable image or a combination of all three.
# Next action
In this component the user choses whether the chatbot should wait for the users reply or just continue to the next node and skip the users input.
