# node-red-watson-designer

# Description

This project was creating in partnership with IBM and the UCL IXN. The aim of this project is to create a plugin for 
Node-RED for the purpose of building a watson Assistant chatbot. This is a Proof of Concept initially but is released 
to open-source for further development! 

### abstract 
Chatbots are AI agents that are rapidly becoming popular in the modern age. 
The Watson Assistant is a lets you build, train and deploy conversational interactions and create a chatbot. 
Node-RED removes lower-level abstractions in web application development. It allows users to drag and drop nodes, connect
them together to rapidly and easily build and deploy software. Sponsored by IBM, this project aims to integrate these two 
systems as a proof of concept (PoC) with a further attempt at integrating Watson Discovery (a powerful AI Search technology).
This would allow users (particularly with less technical literacy) to easily design, deploy and host a chatbot. All on Node-REDs user-friendly environment.
Example use cases include a small non-technical business owner wanting a basic chatbot on their companiesâ€™ site.
