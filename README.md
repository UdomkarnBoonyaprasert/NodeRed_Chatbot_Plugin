# node-red-watson-designer

## Description

This project was creating in partnership with IBM and the UCL IXN. The aim of this project is to create a plugin for 
Node-RED for the purpose of building a watson Assistant chatbot. This is a Proof of Concept initially but is released 
to open-source for further development! 

#### abstract 
Chatbots are AI agents that are rapidly becoming popular in the modern age. 
The Watson Assistant is a lets you build, train and deploy conversational interactions and create a chatbot. 
Node-RED removes lower-level abstractions in web application development. It allows users to drag and drop nodes, connect
them together to rapidly and easily build and deploy software. Sponsored by IBM, this project aims to integrate these two 
systems as a proof of concept (PoC) with a further attempt at integrating Watson Discovery (a powerful AI Search technology).
This would allow users (particularly with less technical literacy) to easily design, deploy and host a chatbot. All on Node-REDs user-friendly environment.
Example use cases include a small non-technical business owner wanting a basic chatbot on their companiesâ€™ site. 

## Visuals

## Installation
Follow these instructions to install the chatbot locally:

#### Requirements

* NodeJS Version 12.16.1 or higher
* Node-RED v1.0.3 
* All other requirements should install with package installation

## Installation
#### Local installation
* After installing Node-RED [(Instruction on install here).](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/local)
* Download this repo into a local repository and navigate into it.
* run the command: 

```console
(sudo) npm install -g
```

* run the local node-red system

#### Connecting Watson Assistant
* Log in to IBM cloud
* Navigate to Watson at the bottom of the drop down menu at the top right of the page
* Create a Watson Assistant Instance
* Copy Past the API key and Hosting URL into the metadata node for this chatbot.
* Your chatbot will now be connected!

## Running

1) Run node-red with the following command
    ```console
        $> node-red
    ```
2) You must first build the chatbot. To do this you must build the dialog tree with each of the nodes 
in the system. Detailed instruction can be seen in each nodes page. The minimum chatbot requires:
    * Metadata node
    * CreateWatson Node
    * Dialog Nodes
    * host node
 2) Deploy the chatbot
 3) Click the button on the metadata node to activate the system and build the chatbot
 5) The chatbot is now compiled. You will be able to access the test interface by navigating to 
 <node-red url> + test.html
 6) You now have a running chatbot.

## Basic Overview

## Contributing
Original contributions were made by a team of UCL Students. However after completion of the project and 
publication to open source. This project will be taken over by the IBM Node-RED development team for 
open source management.  Hence, contributions should follow Node-RED guidelines.
